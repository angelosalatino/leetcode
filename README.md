# Leetcode

In this repository, you will find my personal solutions to some Leetcode (https://leetcode.com) problems.

Please, consider that my solutions not necessarily are the most efficient nor elegant. I develop them when I have free time (mostly Sundays), and perhaps when I need to disconnect from my work. For me the only goal is that the code works and succeeds the unit tests. Besides, I do this to train myself in thinking about a problem at different level of abstraction, and perhaps get a bit creative, without the pressure that the code needs to be as efficient as possible.

Nonetheless, these solutions can be of inspiration for some of you too. So I leave this repository public.

Enjoy.

Angelo
